# javascriptPasswordGenerator
I was tasked to create a password generator for a company so that their employee with sensitive can always use a different secure password for their data. I created this password generator with preexisting html information I was provide. by utilizing JavaScript I created a password generator that creates a password for the user based on the length they select (minimum 8 characters and max 128 character) and with what special characters they want (minimum one type of special characters.). You can uses the password generator here  https://lyricsduda.github.io/javascriptPasswordGenerator/.
